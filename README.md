# hello-world
My first try in Github.
This is a new and first branch of hello-world.
How to use Github:
(1)create your own "repository" and get the defult branch named master;
(2)create a new "branch" and the branch will get a copy of master branch;
(3)make changes into the new branch as you like and "commit" your changes;
(4)when it is time and you want the master branch to accept the changes made in the new branch, create the "pull request" and "merge" the pull request and the master will accept the changes in branch and update;
(5)if you want to delete the new branch, "delete" the branch.
